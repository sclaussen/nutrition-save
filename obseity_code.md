## The Obesity Code

- Summary
  - Total Energy Expenditure is the sum of
    - Basil metabolic rate (BMR)
    - Thermogenic effect of food
    - Non-exercise activity (thermogenesis)
    - Excess post exercise oxygen consumption
    - Exercise
  - **Calorie**: Foods are burned in a lab and energy released is measured as calories
  - Hormones
    - [Leptin](https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/leptin)
    - [Ghrelin](https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/ghrelin)
    - [Peptide YY](https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/peptide-yy)
    - [Cholecystokinin](https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/cholecystokinin)
    - [Insulin](https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/insulin)
    - [Glucagon](https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/glucagon)
    - [Glycogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogenesis): Glucose to liver based glycogen
    - [De novo lipogenesis](tbd): Glucose to fat conversion
    - [Cortisol](https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/cortisol):
  - Organs/Glands
    - [Pancrease](https://www.yourhormones.info/glands/pancreas)
      - It makes digestive juices, which consist of powerful enzymes. These are released into the small bowel after meals to break down and digest food.
      - It makes hormones that control blood glucose levels.
    - Kidney:
    - Liver:
  - Insulin Cycle
    - Consume carbohydrates
    - More glucose in our blood stream than we can currently use
    - Pancreas up regulates insulin (half life of only 2-3 minutes)
    - Insulin signals the cells to uptake the glucose for storage for later use
    - Glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver (glycogensis)
    - Once full, glucose is stored as triglycerides in fat tissue (de nova lipogenesis)
    - Glucogen can be quickly supplied to the body by the liver when glucose is unavailable in the blood stream, but the amount is limited
    - Glucose is available from the fat stores but it is more difficult to access

- Ch3: Failure of the eat less and exercise more theory of weight loss
  - Key assumption of the caloric reduction theory of weight loss
    - Invalid assumption #1: Calories in and calories out are independent of each other
    - Invalid assumption #2: BMR is stable
    - Invalid assumption #3: Eating is a conscious decision (hunger plays a minor role)
    - Invalid assumption #4: Fat stores are unregulated
    - Invalid assumption #5: A calorie is a calorie
  - Metabolic processing of food
    - Protein: Broken down into amino acids to build/repair tissues, excess is stored
    - Fats: Directly abosrbed
    - Carbs: Broken down into sugars
    - Fiber: Moves through

- Ch6: A New Hope
  - Hormonal theory vs Cal in/out theory
    - Invalid assumption #1: Calories in and calories out are independent of each other
      - Tightly synchronized
    - Invalid assumption #2: BMR is stable
      - Hormonal signals adjust BMR to gain/lose weight
    - Invalid assumption #3: Eating is a conscious decision (hunger plays a minor role)
      - Hunger and satiety hormones play a key role wrt whether we eat
    - Invalid assumption #4: Fat stores are unregulated
      - Fat stores are tightly regulated and respond to food intake
    - Invalid assumption #5: A calorie is a calorie
      - Different calories result in different responses
  - Hormones: Molecules that deliver messages to cells
  - Insulin's half life is 2 to 3 minutes

- Ch7: Insulin
