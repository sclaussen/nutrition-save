## The Obesity Code

- Ch3: Failure of the eat less and exercise more theory of weight loss
  - Key assumption of the caloric reduction theory of weight loss
    - Invalid assumption #1: Calories in and calories out are independent of each other
    - Invalid assumption #2: BMR is stable
    - Invalid assumption #3: Eating is a conscious decision (hunger plays a minor role)
    - Invalid assumption #4: Fat stores are unregulated
    - Invalid assumption #5: A calorie is a calorie
  - Metabolic processing of food
    - Protein: Broken down into amino acids to build/repair tissues, excess is stored
    - Fats: Directly abosrbed
    - Carbs: Broken down into sugars
    - Fiber: Moves through

- Ch6: A New Hope
  - Hormonal obesity theory vs Caloric reduction theory
    - Invalid assumption #1: Calories in and calories out are independent of each other
      - Tightly synchronized
    - Invalid assumption #2: BMR is stable
      - Hormonal signals adjust BMR to either gain/lose weight
    - Invalid assumption #3: Eating is a conscious decision (hunger plays a minor role)
      - Hunger and satiety hormones play a key role wrt whether we eat
    - Invalid assumption #4: Fat stores are unregulated
      - Fat stores are tightly regulated and respond to food intake
    - Invalid assumption #5: A calorie is a calorie
      - Different calories result in different responses
  - Insulin's half life is 2 to 3 minutes
  - Mechanics of digestion
    - Hormones: Molecules that deliver messages to cells
    - Hormones bind to acceptors on the cell surface
    - Insulin binds to insulin receptors on cell surfaces
    - After binding, receptor opens and glucose enters
    - Protein: Broken down into amino acids to build/repair tissues, excess is stored, raises insulin but has little impact on glucose levels
    - Fats: Directly abosrbed
    - Carbs: Broken down into sugars
    - Fiber: Moves through w/out absorption
  - Body Set Weight
    - What regulates body set weight?

- Ch7: Insulin
  - "I can make you fat"
    - by prescribing insulin
    - obese secret more insulin and the elevated levels take longer to return to normal
    - high correlation of insulin levels to obesity
    - fasting insulin level
  - San Antonio Heart Study
    - high fasting insulin highly correlated to weight gain
  - "Insulin Causes Obesity" Hypothesis
    - Numerous studies have demonstrated the fact
    - Insulin used to treat both Type 1 and Type 2
  - Insulin & Leptin are quasi opposites
    - In obese people, insulin and leptin are both problematic

- Ch8: Cortisol
  - Stress hormone, fight or flight
  - Cortisol moves glucose out of liver/fat making it available to muscles for immediate use
  - Works well if you're being chased by a predator, but doesn't work well for chronic life stresses
  - Under chronic stress, glucose levels remain high, requiring up regulation of insulin levels
  - Result is that the body is constantly in "store fat" mode

- Ch9: Atkins
