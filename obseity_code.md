## The Obesity Code

- Ch3: Failure of the eat less and exercise more theory of weight loss
  - Key assumption of the caloric reduction theory of weight loss
    - Invalid assumption #1: Calories in and calories out are independent of each other
    - Invalid assumption #2: BMR is stable
    - Invalid assumption #3: Eating is a conscious decision (hunger plays a minor role)
    - Invalid assumption #4: Fat stores are unregulated
    - Invalid assumption #5: A calorie is a calorie
  - Metabolic processing of food
    - Protein: Broken down into amino acids to build/repair tissues, excess is stored
    - Fats: Directly abosrbed
    - Carbs: Broken down into sugars
    - Fiber: Moves through

- Ch6: A New Hope
  - Hormonal obesity theory vs Caloric reduction theory
    - Invalid assumption #1: Calories in and calories out are independent of each other
      - Tightly synchronized
    - Invalid assumption #2: BMR is stable
      - Hormonal signals adjust BMR to either gain/lose weight
    - Invalid assumption #3: Eating is a conscious decision (hunger plays a minor role)
      - Hunger and satiety hormones play a key role wrt whether we eat
    - Invalid assumption #4: Fat stores are unregulated
      - Fat stores are tightly regulated and respond to food intake
    - Invalid assumption #5: A calorie is a calorie
      - Different calories result in different responses
  - Body Set Weight
  - Insulin's half life is 2 to 3 minutes
  - Mechanics of digestion
    - Hormones: Molecules that deliver messages to cells
    - Hormones bind to acceptors on the cell surface
    - Insulin binds to insulin receptors on cell surfaces
    - After binding, receptor opens and glucose enters
    - Protein: Broken down into amino acids to build/repair tissues, excess is stored
    - Fats: Directly abosrbed
    - Carbs: Broken down into sugars
    - Fiber: Moves through

- Ch7: Insulin
  - "I can make you fat" (prescribing insulin)
