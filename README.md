# Notes on Food Categories



## Liquids

- I drink black coffee atleast once a day
- I drink green or black tea frequently
- I consume a lot of water (and I'll add lemon if it's around my meal
  time)
- I try hard to hit my minimum daily water requirement everyday
- I rarely drink alcohol, and any other form of liquid consumption
  that would result in consumption of calories (eg sports drinks,
  fruit drinks, et al)



## Oils

- I add extra virgin olive oil (typically organic) to my salads.
- I cook eggs in organic coconut oil.
- I cook most everything else in avocado oil.



## Meats

- I primarily consume chicken, beef, pork chops, salmon, cod, eggs,
  sardines, mackerel, and occasionally tuna and bacon.  Due to
  potential mercury content issues, I eat Tuna less than once per
  month.

- I source my chicken, beef, pork chops, salmon, and cod from `
  butcher box.  If you're interested in trying butcher box we can
  provide a referral.

- Chicken
  - organic, free range, non-gmo (https://support.butcherbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015793928-Can-you-tell-me-about-your-chicken-)

- Beef
  - grass raised and grass finished (https://support.butcherbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000094648-Can-you-tell-me-about-your-beef-)
  - Even though I wanted a lot of fat in my diet (approx 70%) I will
    consume 80/20, 85/15, and 90/10 beef, but typically it's 85/15.
    The value of 90/10 though as an example is that I can consciously
    decide what type and how much fat to add to the meal so it is a
    bit more flexible.

- Salmon
  - Wild Alaskan sockeye (I stay away from farm raised)

- Sardines, Mackeral, Tuna
  - All sourced from Wild Planet

- Eggs
  - Organic Pasture Raised typically sourced from Vital Farms



## Vegetables

- Leafy Greens

  - I currently use a combination of Baby Arugula, Collared Greens,
    and Romaine.

  - I have used Spinach and Chard as well, but they both have high
    levels of oxalates that can result in kidney stones so for that
    reason I typically avoid them now in my salads.

  - I love Kale as well, but it has a relatively high carb footprint
    if you're building a large salad with it, so I don't use it often.

  - I have used cabbage from time to time.

- My staples are mushrooms, radish, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus,
  brussel sprouts, green beans, and serrano peppers.



## Fruits

Generally speaking, due to their high carb content and the health
issues associated with fructose, I simply have stopped consuming
fruits altogether.

Avocados are the sole exception, and they are a staple in my daily
diet.



## Dairy

I have stopped consuming milk due to its high carb content (lactose).

I consume a lot of cheese.



## Nuts

I consume Pecans, Walnuts, and Macadamia nuts.  Occasionally I'll
consume the higher carbohydrate nuts like peanuts and almonds, but in
very small quantities.  I avoid all the other high carbohydrate nuts
(like pistaccio and cashew).

## Seeds

I consume low carbohydrate seeds as a mechanism to maintain minimum
daily fiber requirements and as a source of vitamins and minerals
including chia seeds, flax seeds, and pumpkin seeds.


## Breads

I do not consume any cereals, breads, rice, et al.



## Snacks

The only snack I consume is small amounts of dark chocolate (85/88%)
on occasion.
