![](https://i.dietdoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/keto-diet-guide-avoid2.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=800&h=401&fit=crop)



## Liquids

- I refrain from consuming any calories in liquid form (eg sports drinks,
  orange juice, milk, smoothy, et al)
- I rarely drink alcohol
- I drink black coffee atleast once a day, often multiple times (zero calories)
- I drink hot green tea or black ice tea frequently (zero calories)
- I consume a lot of water
- I try hard to hit my minimum daily water requirement daily



## Sweetener

- The only sweetener I use is Stevia but it's relatively rare.
- I avoid everything other than dark chocolate that has any added sugar.



## Spices

- I use quite a few spices including garlic, tumeric, peppers, garam
  masala, ...  That said, I'm careful not to consume spices that
  contain carbs.



## Oils

- I add extra virgin olive oil (typically organic) to my salads.
- I cook eggs in organic coconut oil (mcts).
- I cook most everything else in avocado oil (high smoke point).
- On occasion I'll cook in butter or ghee (primarily ghee).



## Meats

- I primarily consume chicken, beef, pork chops, salmon, cod, eggs,
  sardines, mackerel, and occasionally tuna, bacon, lamb, and venison.

- I avoid all high mercury content fish, and limit tuna consumption to
  once per month max.

- I source my chicken, beef, pork chops, salmon, and cod from
  butcher box.  If you're interested in trying butcher box I can
  provide a referral.

- Chicken
  - Organic, free range, non-gmo (https://support.butcherbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015793928-Can-you-tell-me-about-your-chicken-)

- Beef
  - Grass raised and grass finished (https://support.butcherbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000094648-Can-you-tell-me-about-your-beef-)

  - Even though I wanted a lot of fat in my diet (approx 70%) I will
    consume 80%/20%, 85%/15%, and 90%/10% beef, but typically it's
    85%/15%.  That said, if given a choice I'll eat leaner meat not
    because I'm trying to avoid fat, but as a way to provide me
    flexibility wrt how I consume high quality fat (eg olive oil,
    nuts, et al).

- Salmon
  - Wild Alaskan sockeye (I stay away from farm raised)

- Sardines, Mackeral, Tuna
  - All sourced from Wild Planet

- Eggs
  - Organic Pasture Raised (typically sourced from [Vital Farms](https://www.cornucopia.org/scorecard/eggs/vital-farms))

On the topic of eggs, recently I purchased a dozen organic pasture
raised eggs from a local farm (Clover) before verifying the farm's
rating on cornucopia (mistake)!  These eggs typically sell for
$7.29/dozen so they are expensive.  The first time I cracked the
clover egg, it was obvious that it had a thinner shell than the Vital
eggs I was used to, and the yellow and bland color of the yolk made it
obvious that they were lower quality.  Here's a photo of Clover and
Vital eggs, obvious which is which?!

## Vegetables

- Leafy Greens

  - I currently use a combination of baby arugula, collared greens,
    and romaine.

  - I have used spinach and chard as well, but they both have high
    levels of oxalates that can result in kidney stones so for that
    reason I typically avoid them.

  - I love kale as well, but it has a relatively high carb footprint
    if you're building a large salad with it, so I don't use it often.

  - I have used cabbage from time to time, but it has a high carb
    footprint as well.

- Avocados (actually a fruit) are a key staple of my diet.

- My other vegetable staples are mushrooms, radish, broccoli,
  cauliflower, asparagus, brussel sprouts, green beans, serrano
  peppers, and zucchini.

- On occasion I'll have tomatoes, onions, carrots, peas, etal, but
  they have a higher carb footprint.

- I avoid most starchy vegetables.

## Fruits

- Generally speaking, due to their high carb content and the health
  issues associated with fructose, I simply have stopped consuming
  fruits altogether.

- If I do consume fruit (delta avocado), it's one of the berries
  (strawberry, blackberry, rasberry, or blueberry) due to their
  relatively low carb footprint.

- I will consume lemons in my water around mealtime on occasion as
  their acidity helps break down the calcium oxalates and aids in
  speeding up digestion which offsets their carb content.

## Dairy

- Long ago, I stopped consuming milk due to its high carb content
  (lactose).

- I consume a lot of cheese (typically feta, parmesan, blue,
  mozareally, mitica, machnego, gouda, or emmentaler).

- I cook in ghee or butter occasionally.

## Nuts

- I only consume raw nuts.

- I consume organic nuts when they are not price prohibitive.

- I consume pecans, walnuts, cocnut, and macadamia nuts (I avoid both
  hazel and brazil nuts due to allergies).

- Occasionally I'll consume the higher carb footprint nuts like
  peanuts and almonds.

- I refrain from all the other higher carb footprint nuts (like
  pistacio and cashew).

## Seeds

- I consume low carbohydrate seeds as a mechanism to maintain minimum
  daily fiber requirements and as a source of vitamins and minerals
  including chia seeds, flax seeds, and pumpkin seeds.

- I frequently add stone ground mustard to my salads and brugers to
  increase the spice.

- Reference

## Legumes, Grains, ...

- I do not consume any cereals, breads, rice, et al.

## Snacks

- The only snack food I consume is small amounts of dark chocolate
  (typically 80%+) on occasion.



# Intermittent Fasting

How do you get started???

Initially, I recommend removing all snacking between meals (simple
insulin management).

Find something to drink between meals that's calorie free in addition
to water.  Typically that's black coffee or expresso (without
milk/sugar), green tea, or black tea.  Anytime you get hungry between
meals, drink water, make yourself coffee, or green tea.

On day one, I recommend starting out by alternating eating and fasting
in 12 hour windows.  For example, eat between 8am and 8pm, three
meals, without snacks between.  This should be trivial, and it's quite
likely you can skip to the next phase.

When you're comfortable with that, move to an 16/8 plan, eating during
an 8 hour window and fasting during a 16 hour window.  For example,
eat between 11am and 7pm, two meals, without snacks between, fast the
remainder of the time.

When you're comfortable with that, move to an 18/6, 20/4, and/or 22/2
plan, in phases as you are comfortable allowinug your body to adjust,
continuing along the same lines, eating two meals, trying to finish by
7pm (as an example).

When you're comfortable with that, try one meal a day (OMAD),
combining all your calories into a single meal, at say 5 or 6pm each
day.

Here was my progression as an example:
- On day 1 I stopped snacking between meals.
- On day 8 I began a 16/8 plan (11am-7pm), 3 meals a day.
- On day 11 I transitioned my 16/8 plan to (11am-7pm) 2 meals a day (3 was way too filling for me).
- On day 16 I began a 20/4 plan (3pm-7pm), 2 meals a day.
- On day 18 I tried one meal a day (OMAD) (6-7pm), but reverted to 20/4, as I felt at the time it was too much food at one time (my body wasn't yet able to digest that mount).
- On day 34 I began using OMAD and haven't looked back.  I typically eat around 4:30.



# Meals

I basically combine my breakfast, lunch, and dinner into a single
meal.

My meal typically consists of:
- Salad: Staples include various leafy greens, avocado, mushrooms, radish, extra virgin olive oil, fish oil
- Omelette: Staples include serrano peppers and hot salsa
- Meat
- Cheese

The advantage of a salad and an omelette is they provide a lot of
flexibility for mixing in various ingredients.  On occasion I'll add
the omelette and/or the meat directly into the salad, and other times
eat them separately.



# Meal Prep

My meal prep process is pretty straightforward:

- I typically prep all my vegetables ahead of time to speed up the
  meal prep.  This includes dicing mushrooms, radishes, et al.
- I plan my meal ahead of time using my spreadsheet so I know how much
  of what ingredients to add.  I usually take an IPhone photo of my
  plan to recall all the details as I'm prepping the meal.
- To keep things simple, I typically either use grams or tablespoons
  as the normalized unit.  Thus, ingredients like leafy greens,
  mushrooms, radish, are added to the bowl using grams, and things
  like olive oil, fish oil, and mustard are added in tablespoon units.
  For other ingredients I'll plan using "N eggs", or "N squares of
  chocolate", etc.
- I put a 3 or 5qt salad bowl on my grams scale.  As I add ingredients
  to the salad, I add them directly to the salad bowl, zeroing out the
  scale after each addition, so I don't have to measure the
  ingredients separately before adding.  This speeds everything up.
- I put a small pot on the scale and add broccoli and/or cauliflower
  (when using those vegetables), taring as I go, then add water, and
  warm up or boil the vegetables, strain, and dump them directly into
  the salad.  Recently I just warm them up a bit, as boiling removes
  some portion of the nutrients.
- I put coconut oil and serrano pepers in an omelette pan, and then
  add eggs for the omelette, and when it's nearly done cooking I add
  the salsa (I like it hot).  At times I add the omelette directly to
  the salad.
- Separately I cook the meat and/or other vegetables.  At times I add
  those directly to the salad.

Here's how I prepare a sample meal:

- Salad
  - Put a 5qt bowl on the scale, tare it
  - Add 100g of collard greens
  - Add 100g of romaine (scale says 200g)
  - Add 145g of baby argula (scale says 345g), tare the scale
  - Add 140g of avocado (~ medium avocado), tare the scale
  - Add 100g of diced white mushrooms
  - Add 100g of diced radish (scale will say 200g)
  - Add one can of drained mackerel
  - Add 4tbsp of extra virgin olive oil
  - Add 3tbsp of stone ground mustard to salad
  - Add garlic powder spice
  - Put a small boiling pan on the scale, tare the scale
  - Add 100g broccoli
  - Add 100g cauliflower (scael will say 200g)
  - Add water to the top of the vegetables, bring the pan to a boil, strain water
  - Dump the broccoli and cauliflower into the salad
  - Mix, toss, and serve!
- Omelette
  - Add 1tbsp coconut oil to an omelette pan, melt it on low/medium
  - Add 4 diced serrano peppers, sautee lightly
  - Add 5 eggs, cook over low/medium
  - Add 3tbsp salsa
  - Add 1tbsp of green pepper sauce
- Meat
  - Broil 200g of trip tip steak



# Macros

## Protein

To determine your daily protein need, multiply you LBM by the appropriate activity level.
- Sedentary (generally physically inactive): multiply by 0.5
- Light activity (includes walking or gardening): multiply by 0.6
- Moderate (30 minutes of moderate activity, thrice weekly): multiply by 0.7
- Active (one hour of exercise, five times weekly): multiply by 0.8
- Very active (10 to 20 hours of exercise weekly): multiply by 0.9
- Athlete (over 20 hours of exercise weekly): multiply by 1.0
