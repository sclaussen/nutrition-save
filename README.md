# Notes on Food Categories



## Liquids

- I drink black coffee atleast once a day
- I drink green or black tea frequently
- I consume a lot of water (and I'll add lemon if it's around my meal
  time)
- I try hard to hit my minimum daily water requirement everyday
- I rarely drink alcohol, and any other form of liquid consumption
  that would result in consumption of calories (eg sports drinks,
  fruit drinks, et al)



## Sweetener

The only sweetener I use is Stevia but it's relatively rare.


## Spices

I use quite a few spices including garlic, tumeric, ...



## Oils

- I add extra virgin olive oil (typically organic) to my salads.
- I cook eggs in organic coconut oil.
- I cook most everything else in avocado oil.



## Meats

- I primarily consume chicken, beef, pork chops, salmon, cod, eggs,
  sardines, mackerel, and occasionally tuna and bacon.  Due to
  potential mercury content issues, I eat Tuna less than once per
  month.

- I source my chicken, beef, pork chops, salmon, and cod from `
  butcher box.  If you're interested in trying butcher box we can
  provide a referral.

- Chicken
  - organic, free range, non-gmo (https://support.butcherbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015793928-Can-you-tell-me-about-your-chicken-)

- Beef
  - grass raised and grass finished (https://support.butcherbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000094648-Can-you-tell-me-about-your-beef-)
  - Even though I wanted a lot of fat in my diet (approx 70%) I will
    consume 80/20, 85/15, and 90/10 beef, but typically it's 85/15.
    The value of 90/10 though as an example is that I can consciously
    decide what type and how much fat to add to the meal so it is a
    bit more flexible.

- Salmon
  - Wild Alaskan sockeye (I stay away from farm raised)

- Sardines, Mackeral, Tuna
  - All sourced from Wild Planet

- Eggs
  - Organic Pasture Raised typically sourced from Vital Farms



## Vegetables

- Leafy Greens

  - I currently use a combination of Baby Arugula, Collared Greens,
    and Romaine.

  - I have used Spinach and Chard as well, but they both have high
    levels of oxalates that can result in kidney stones so for that
    reason I typically avoid them now in my salads.

  - I love Kale as well, but it has a relatively high carb footprint
    if you're building a large salad with it, so I don't use it often.

  - I have used cabbage from time to time.

- Avocados (really a fruit) are a key daily staple in my diet.

- My staples are mushrooms, radish, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus,
  brussel sprouts, green beans, and serrano peppers.

- On occasion I'll have onions or carrots but they have a higher carb
  content.

## Fruits

Generally speaking, due to their high carb content and the health
issues associated with fructose, I simply have stopped consuming
fruits altogether.

If I do consume fruit, its one of the berries (strawberry, blackberry,
rasberry, or blueberry).

I will consume lemons in my water around mealtime on occasion as their
acidity helps break down the calcium oxalates and aids in speeding up
digestion which offsets their carb content.

## Dairy

I have stopped consuming milk due to its high carb content (lactose).

I consume a lot of cheese.  I cook in ghee or butter occasionally.

## Nuts

- I consume Pecans, Walnuts, and Macadamia nuts (I avoid Brazil as I
  think I'm allergic).  These nuts help when I need to add some fat
  content to roudn out my meal.

- Occasionally (but rarely now) I'll consume the higher carbohydrate
  nuts like peanuts and almonds, but in very small quantities.  I
  avoid all the other high carbohydrate nuts (like pistaccio and
  cashew).

## Seeds

I consume low carbohydrate seeds as a mechanism to maintain minimum
daily fiber requirements and as a source of vitamins and minerals
including chia seeds, flax seeds, and pumpkin seeds.

I also add stone ground mustard to my salads to increase the spice and
my burgers.



## Breads

I do not consume any cereals, breads, rice, et al.



## Snacks

The only snack I consume is small amounts of dark chocolate (85/88%)
on occasion.



# Intermittent Fasting

How do you get started???

Initially, I recommend removing all snacking between meals (simple
insulin management).

Find something to drink between meals that's calorie free in addition
to water.  Typically that's black coffee or expresso (without
milk/sugar), green tea, or black tea.  Anytime you get hungry between
meals, drink water, make yourself coffee, or green tea.

On day one, I recommend starting out by alternating eating and fasting
in 12 hour windows.  For example, eat between 8am and 8pm, three
meals, without snacks between.  This should be trivial, and it's quite
likely you can skip to the next phase.

When you're comfortable with that, move to an 16/8 plan, eating during
an 8 hour window and fasting during a 16 hour window.  For example,
eat between 11am and 7pm, two meals, without snacks between, fast the
remainder of the time.

When you're comfortable with that, move to an 18/6, 20/4, and/or 22/2
plan, in phases as you are comfortable allowinug your body to adjust,
continuing along the same lines, eating two meals, trying to finish by
7pm (as an example).

When you're comfortable with that, try one meal a day (OMAD),
combining all your calories into a single meal, at say 5 or 6pm each
day.

Here was my progression as an example:
- On day 1 I stopped snacking between meals.
- On day 8 I began a 16/8 plan (11am-7pm), 3 meals a day.
- On day 11 I transitioned my 16/8 plan to (11am-7pm) 2 meals a day (3 was way too filling for me).
- On day 16 I began a 20/4 plan (3pm-7pm), 2 meals a day.
- On day 18 I tried one meal a day (OMAD) (6-7pm), but reverted to 20/4, as I felt at the time it was too much food at one time (my body wasn't yet able to digest that mount).
- On day 34 I began using OMAD and haven't looked back.  I typically eat around 4:30.



# Protein

To determine your daily protein need, multiply you LBM by the appropriate activity level.
- Sedentary (generally physically inactive): multiply by 0.5
- Light activity (includes walking or gardening): multiply by 0.6
- Moderate (30 minutes of moderate activity, thrice weekly): multiply by 0.7
- Active (one hour of exercise, five times weekly): multiply by 0.8
- Very active (10 to 20 hours of exercise weekly): multiply by 0.9
- Athlete (over 20 hours of exercise weekly): multiply by 1.0
